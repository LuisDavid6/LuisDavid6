<h1 align="center"> Hi I'm Luis 👋🧑‍💻</h1>

<br/>
<p style="margin:35px">
    I'm a Full Stack developer, I am currently finishing the SoyHenry bootcamp where I have acquired a lot of technical knowledge and developed personal skills, which have helped me grow in this world of technology.<br/><br/>
    I consider myself a person passionate about constant learning, focused on the search for new challenges where I can put my skills to the test while acquiring new knowledge.<br/><br/>
    As an organized and highly motivated person, I am capable of adapting to any circumstance and always giving my best in any project, while at the same time making an effort to work as a team and promote values such as camaraderie.<br/><br/>
    I have also had the opportunity to work in a team where I was able to familiarize myself with agile methodologies (SCRUM), as well as develop communication skills that facilitate progress towards a common goal in an efficient and harmonious manner.
